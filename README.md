Hey there, I’m @kindadim! I'm a 21 year old student studying networking and Python 
HTML, and CSS, with JavaScript, Rust, and C++ sometime down the line. I’ve got a passion
for computers, both the hardware and software side. My heart does lie with hardware 
though, there's nothing quite like fixing someone's device for them!
