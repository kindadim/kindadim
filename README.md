~ Hey there, I’m @kindadim. I'm a 21 year old student studying networking and Python,
  and hope to expand to HTML, Rust, and C++ sometime down the line. I’ve got a passion
  for computers, both the hardware and software side. My heart does lie with hardware 
  though, there's nothing quite like fixing someone's device for them!
